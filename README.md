Estimating Travel Time
The objective of this document is proposing a prediction model for estimating the travel time of two specified locations at a given departure time. The main idea here is predicting the velocity of the trip. Given the distance between starting and ending point of the trip, it is possible to easily compute the Travel Time. According to the given data, different features including the time of the day, day of the week, month, travel distance, and distance to the center of the city (New York) are used. Different prediction models (Linear, GLM and Deep Neural Network) are compared, and the GLM is used for genrating the final results.
